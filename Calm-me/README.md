# YHack2015 - Calme
This is an Android App built to help with PTSD symptoms, with a focus on the sufferers' panic attacks. 

### HOW IT WORKS

The app requires the use of a Microsoft Band.

Through the use of the band, the user's heart rate is monitored, and with it, we determine whether they are in the danger zone and require assistance. If they remain in that state for a relatively long period of time without Sport mode on, the app will send a message to all the emergency contacts the user will add. The message will contain a help message along with their current location. If the user has put the app in sports mode, the app will not alert contacts when the heartrate reaches its threshold.

The second feature is letting the user voluntarily open the feature when they are able to, and listen to some soothing music to calm them down.  
### HOW TO INSTALL 
 1. Make sure you have Eclipse or Android Studios installed.
